# Documentation of our database
instead of using MongoDB, our group used DyanmoDB. We had this checked off by professor Berger and the TA's and they gave us the thumbs up for it.
 We chose to use dynamoDB as we are also using aws-sdk so it seemed logical and more fluid to use DyanmoDB. 
 We made a crud.js file to implement all our create,retreive/get,update, and delete operations for our db. 
 This was then exported to  server.js and utilized for our incoming operation actions.
