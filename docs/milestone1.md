Innovative Idea 
creating a website which offers 2 parts. The first part will offer a text box for user input. The user will enter any amount of text into the box, and after hitting enter, the backend will return a sentiment score among a few other things like the language of the text (using AWS's pre-trained NLP API) for the user inputted comment, as well as log this user inputted text + sentiment results in a database. The second part would display all of the previously logged comments that the user has ever inputted, along with each comment's respective sentiment results, and will also allow the user to delete specific comments from that database on this webpage.
