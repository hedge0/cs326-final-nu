## About Sentiment Analyzer

Sentiment Analyzer is a web application that gives users the ability to analyze segments of text by Amazon's Comprehend services. Users have the ability to enter a document up to 20 KB in size, and in turn receive sentiment statistics. Users can also choose to update and override these statistics if they choose to, and download their history of submissions.. We sought out to bring an easy to use interface around Amazon's Comprehend services.
